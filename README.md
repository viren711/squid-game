## Introduction

Welcome to the Red Light Green Light IoT Project, a groundbreaking fusion of technology and nostalgia. We've brought to life the heart-pounding game from the Korean sensational web series, Squid Game. Just like in the show, participants must freeze on a "red light" to survive. Caught moving during this phase? You're out. But when the "green light" flashes, the race to the finish line begins.

Join us on an adventure where the worlds of technology, education, and entertainment collide. Our project employs an Arduino UNO R3, LEDs, an Ultrasonic Sensor HC-SR04, and an Electronic Buzzer to recreate the excitement and challenges of the original game.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An Arduino UNO board
- Appropriate cables for connecting the components
- Arduino IDE installed on your computer

## How It Works

This project faithfully replicates the core rules of the Red Light Green Light game:

- **Ultrasonic Sensor:** It works by emitting high-frequency sound waves that bounce off objects in its path. By measuring the time it takes for the sound waves to return, the sensor calculates the distance to the object.

- **LED Control:** The LEDs act as the game's traffic lights, signaling ðŸŸ¢green and ðŸ”´red lights as participants race against time. The Arduino skillfully coordinates this dramatic display in accordance with the game's rules.

- **Player Interaction:** Participants fully immerse themselves in the game, navigating within a predefined distance of the Ultrasonic sensor. The LEDs respond to their movements, recreating the suspense and excitement of the original game. If a player is caught moving during a "red light," the buzzer sounds, and they are out.

## Conclusion

This project stands as a testament to the incredible potential of merging technology with education and entertainment. It showcases the limitless possibilities of technology-driven experiences. We're excited to continue pushing the boundaries, exploring new features, and enhancing the game's experience for all.
